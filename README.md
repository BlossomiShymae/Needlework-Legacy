# FAQ
## General
**Does Needlework use Overwolf?**  
Nope. (Â´ï½¡â€¢ Ï‰ â€¢ï½¡`)

**Can I use Needlework without opening the League of Legends client?**  
Nope. Needlework requires the League of Legends client to be open as it needs to
call the server within (in simple terms). Opening Needlework without an 
open client or closing the client while Needlework is open will give you a very 
sad bee. :c

**Why do I get a page with a sad bee?**  
Needlework was unable to connect with the server of the League of Legends 
client, likely to the reason explained in the above question. u.u

**Am I able to switch accounts while leaving Needlework open?**  
Yes you can! :excited_kitten:

**:bee_happy:?**

## Development

**What framework is used for developing Needlework?**  
Needlework is developed using Vue.js 3 and Electron through nklayman's Vue CLI 
Electron Builder. TypeScript is the primary programming language used for 
processing. More related information can be found in package.json.

**Why was Electron used?**  
I used Electron because, in my opinion (sorry T.T), it is the easiest desktop 
application framework to pick up for my skill set. (Easier development, 
shorter roadblocks, yay!) If this is still an issue, then I'm sorry for being a 
lazy and incompetent developer. :sad_kitten:
